The Queen has sent the royal arhcers after him, and the only way to escape is through the Forgotten Burrows. Thankfully, the archers that are pursuing King have accidentally left their arrows at home, and are only capable of clobbering him with their bows when he comes near enough. These ancient tunnels he must traverse, however, are leading him further and further underground, where the terrain is dangerous and he is far from home.
